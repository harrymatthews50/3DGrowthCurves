% ORIGINAL DOCSTRING
%PLSREGRESS Partial least squares regression.
%   [XLOADINGS,YLOADINGS] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP) computes a partial least
%   squares regression of Y on X, using NCOMP PLS components or latent
%   factors, and returns the predictor and response loadings.  X is an N-by-P
%   matrix of predictor variables, with rows corresponding to observations,
%   columns to variables.  Y is an N-by-M response matrix.  XLOADINGS is a
%   P-by-NCOMP matrix of predictor loadings, where each row of XLOADINGS
%   contains coefficients that define a linear combination of PLS components
%   that approximate the original predictor variables.  YLOADINGS is an
%   M-by-NCOMP matrix of response loadings, where each row of YLOADINGS
%   contains coefficients that define a linear combination of PLS components
%   that approximate the original response variables.
%
%   [XLOADINGS,YLOADINGS,XSCORES] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP) returns the
%   predictor scores, i.e., the PLS components that are linear combinations of
%   the variables in X.  XSCORES is an N-by-NCOMP orthonormal matrix with rows
%   corresponding to observations, columns to components.
%
%   [XLOADINGS,YLOADINGS,XSCORES,YSCORES] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP)
%   returns the response scores, i.e., the linear combinations of the
%   responses with which the PLS components XSCORES have maximum covariance.
%   YSCORES is an N-by-NCOMP matrix with rows corresponding to observations,
%   columns to components.  YSCORES is neither orthogonal nor normalized.
%
%   PLSREGRESS uses the SIMPLS algorithm, and first centers X and Y by
%   subtracting off column means to get centered variables X0 and Y0.
%   However, it does not rescale the columns.  To perform partial least
%   squares regression with standardized variables, use ZSCORE to normalize X
%   and Y.
%
%   If NCOMP is omitted, its default value is MIN(SIZE(X,1)-1, SIZE(X,2)).
%
%   The relationships between the scores, loadings, and centered variables X0
%   and Y0 are
%
%      XLOADINGS = (XSCORES\X0)' = X0'*XSCORES,
%      YLOADINGS = (XSCORES\Y0)' = Y0'*XSCORES,
%
%   i.e., XLOADINGS and YLOADINGS are the coefficients from regressing X0 and
%   Y0 on XSCORES, and XSCORES*XLOADINGS' and XSCORES*YLOADINGS' are the PLS
%   approximations to X0 and Y0.  PLSREGRESS initially computes YSCORES as
%
%      YSCORES = Y0*YLOADINGS = Y0*Y0'*XSCORES,
%
%   however, by convention, PLSREGRESS then orthogonalizes each column of
%   YSCORES with respect to preceding columns of XSCORES, so that
%   XSCORES'*YSCORES is lower triangular.
%
%   [XL,YL,XS,YS,BETA] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP,...) returns the PLS regression
%   coefficients BETA.  BETA is a (P+1)-by-M matrix, containing intercept
%   terms in the first row, i.e., Y = [ONES(N,1) X]*BETA + Yresiduals, and
%   Y0 = X0*BETA(2:END,:) + Yresiduals.
%
%   [XL,YL,XS,YS,BETA,PCTVAR] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP) returns a 2-by-NCOMP
%   matrix PCTVAR containing the percentage of variance explained by the
%   model.  The first row of PCTVAR contains the percentage of variance
%   explained in X by each PLS component and the second row contains the
%   percentage of variance explained in Y.
%
%   [XL,YL,XS,YS,BETA,PCTVAR,MSE] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP) returns a
%   2-by-(NCOMP+1) matrix MSE containing estimated mean squared errors for
%   PLS models with 0:NCOMP components.  The first row of MSE contains mean
%   squared errors for the predictor variables in X and the second row
%   contains mean squared errors for the response variable(s) in Y.
%
%   [XL,YL,XS,YS,BETA,PCTVAR,MSE] = PLSREGRESS(...,'PARAM1',val1,...) allows
%   you to specify optional parameter name/value pairs to control the
%   calculation of MSE.  Parameters are:
%
%      'CV'      The method used to compute MSE.  When 'CV' is a positive
%                integer K, PLSREGRESS uses K-fold cross-validation.  Set
%                'CV' to a cross-validation partition, created using
%                CVPARTITION, to use other forms of cross-validation.  When
%                'CV' is 'resubstitution', PLSREGRESS uses X and Y both to
%                fit the model and to estimate the mean squared errors,
%                without cross-validation.  The default is 'resubstitution'.
%
%      'MCReps'  A positive integer indicating the number of Monte-Carlo
%                repetitions for cross-validation.  The default value is 1.
%                'MCReps' must be 1 if 'CV' is 'resubstitution'.
%      
%      'Options' A structure that specifies options that govern how PLSREGRESS
%                performs cross-validation computations. This argument can be
%                created by a call to STATSET. PLSREGRESS uses the following 
%                fields of the structure:
%                    'UseParallel'
%                    'UseSubstreams'
%                    'Streams'
%                For information on these fields see PARALLELSTATS.
%                NOTE: If supplied, 'Streams' must be of length one.
%
%   
%   [XL,YL,XS,YS,BETA,PCTVAR,MSE,STATS] = PLSREGRESS(X,Y,NCOMP,...) returns a
%   structure that contains the following fields:
%       W            P-by-NCOMP matrix of PLS weights, i.e., XSCORES = X0*W
%       T2           The T^2 statistic for each point in XSCORES
%       Xresiduals   The predictor residuals, i.e. X0 - XSCORES*XLOADINGS'
%       Yresiduals   The response residuals, i.e. Y0 - XSCORES*YLOADINGS'
%
%   Example: Fit a 10 component PLS regression and plot the cross-validation
%   estimate of MSE of prediction for models with up to 10 components.  Plot
%   the observed vs. the fitted response for the 10-component model.
%
%      load spectra
%      [xl,yl,xs,ys,beta,pctvar,mse] = plsregress(NIR,octane,10,'CV',10);
%      plot(0:10,mse(2,:),'-o');
%      octaneFitted = [ones(size(NIR,1),1) NIR]*beta;
%      plot(octane,octaneFitted,'o');
